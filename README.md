# YYC2SWP 
## Y|yukichigai's Caption to Subtitle (with positioning!)

This is a command line Perl script which can convert Closed Captions (Scenarist or [Grid 608](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/blob/master/docs/G608.TXT) format) to more accessible subtitle formats (SubStation, Advanced Substation, WebVTT) while preserving subtitle positioning. This tool is a fork of/based on CCASDI by McPoodle, part of the discontinued [SCC Tools](http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_TOOLS.HTML) project.

# Requirements

yyC2Swp currently requires you have Perl installed on your system, what with it being an uncompiled Perl script and all. Your Perl installation must also support UTF-8 (if you somehow disabled that).

# Usage

```
perl yyC2Swp.pl [-cCC3] [-a] [-o01:00:00:00] [-td] infile.scc [outfile.ass]
```
-c (OPTIONAL): Channel to convert to subtitle. SCC input only. (CC1 default, CC2, CC3, CC4, T1, T2, T3 and T4 are other choices)

-r (OPTIONAL): Output roll-up subtitles in roll-up format, instead of one line at a time

-a (OPTIONAL): Adjust timecodes to be start time for SCC and display time for dissassembly

-o (OPTIONAL): Offset to apply to timecodes, in HH:MM:SS:FF format (DEFAULT: 00:00:00:00, negative values are permitted)

-f (OPTIONAL): Number of frames per second (range 12 - 60) (DEFAULT: 29.97)

-t (OPTIONAL; automatically sets fps to 29.97): NTSC timebase: d (dropframe) or n (non-dropframe) (DEFAULT: n)

NOTE: outfile argument is optional, and will default to the same name as the input file with a different extension (name.scc/g608 -> name.ass). Format is controlled by outfile suffix: .vtt WebVTT, .smi SAMI, .ssa Sub-Station Alpha, .ass Advanced Sub-Station (default), or .ccd SCC Disassembly (SCC input only).

# Credits
This script is modified from CCASDI by McPoodle. Almost all of the caption parsing and SCC <-> CCD conversion logic is their work.
